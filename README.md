# Project
The project is a mobile application for Android, developped using Kotlin and Android Studio Electric Eel.

The application is based around a 'game type' questionnaire, where the user has to answer various questions.

The project has the following elements :
1. Available in two languages : English and French.
2. A main menu page upon launching the application.
3. A drop down menu to navigate around the application.
4. A custom application icon and name.
5. A fun, interactive questionnaire.
     - Image based questionnaire with 4 possible answer choices.
     - When an answer is submitted, shows if the answer is correct or wrong.
     - A progress bar to see how many questions are left.
 6. A fully commented code (functions and lines).

# Next Steps / Upcoming Updates
The contributors will continue to develop the current application. Here are the steps for upcoming updates:

1. Adding the 'Account' section of the application.
     - Possibility to modify the user's name that was entered on application launch.
2. Adding the 'Settings' section of the application.
     - Possibility to change the language of the application without changing the language of the phone.
     - Possibility to switch between Dark/Light mode.
3. Updating the application to keep information in fragments.
     - Store the user's name that is inputted at application launch.
     - Store the user's score for the 'Congratulation' page at the end of the questionnaire.
